# Facial_Recognition_Attendance_Management_System

It is a system designed for marking the attendance of students. For marking attendance, organization usually ask for certain biometric authentication like signature, photo of the students. Our system uses the face recognition authentication feature for identifying the physical presence of students in the class. It will save the precious time of teachers as well as students and increases the accuracy of the record. It will greatly reduce any chance of proxies or false present being marked in the class.

# Motivation

Teachers find trouble in dealing with the attendance of students while doing it by hand as it uses their instructing time. We thought of using machine learning knowledge in building a model which can detect the faces of the students present in the class and mark their attendance automatically. Additionaly, it also solves the problem of proxies and students being marked present even though they are not physically present in the class. 

# Methodology

Following steps were followed to develop smart attendance management system:-

* Enrollment

* Face Detection

* Face Recognition

* Marking Attendance
